To run
======

Either:

Install the app-release.apk on your android phone, it may be necessary to allow installation from unknown sources - google how to do this for your specific android version and phone model

Or:

Follow the instructions here for your machine: 

<http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html>

You may need to refer to some of the information here:

<http://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.23/docs/android-setup.html>

Then before attempting to run the app:

```
npm install
```

Setup a virtual device in genymotion and run it - nexus 5x works well amongst others.

Run `react-native start`

Run `react-native run android`

Tada! It should work.
